# Managers

The manager is a struct that implements one single method: choose a provider base on a technical rule.

## Example

IP warming is the practice of sending emails from a machine to make this IP reputation increase. It start with a small volume and day by day it doubles the previous volume.

In this case you can create a rule that if you already sent 500 email you change for another provider more stable

## Example 2

If you want to use a provider for transactional email and another for marketing email, you can, you'll just have to set a rule based on the title.
